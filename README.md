Chickens can move one step up, left, or right, but not backward or diagonally. Foxes can move one step left, right, up and down. The fox can eat the chicken, as in a game of checkers: if the chicken is followed by a free field one step in the horizontal or vertical direction, then the fox jumps over the chicken and eats it. Foxes are always required to eat, and when they have a choice, they are required to perform the "longest meal". If two meals are of the same length, either one is chosen.

It is necessary to write a program that plays for foxes. The player moves the chickens. Partners play in turn, with the chickens starting. They win the game if nine of them manage to occupy the 9 squares that form the top square of the field. The foxes win if they manage to eat 12 chickens. in this case, there will not be enough chickens left to occupy the top 9 spaces.
